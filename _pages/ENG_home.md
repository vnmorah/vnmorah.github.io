## About Valeria

<a <img src= '/assets/images/aboutphoto.jpg > /a>

I am Valeria Mora-Hernández, Spanish Literature Ph.D. and Life Coach. My life has been shaped by my experience being a (white-passing) female of color together with being a first-generation immigrant, first-generation Ph.D., college instructor, researcher and academic writer. 

Either as a Ph.D. or as a Coach, I support you in the process of developing the skills that will help you succeed in your academic, professional, and/or personal life.

Through more than 10 years in Higher Education, I have learned that *well-being is the best strategy you can use to achieve personal and professional success*. However, well-being and success look different for everyone! As a coach, I support you in the process of identifying how do well-being and success look for your within your unique context while we work towards accomplishing your personal and professional goals. 

As a Spanish Literature Ph.D., I am a specialist in Early Modern Spanish narrative as well as in teaching Spanish as a foreign language. I can assist you in the process of learning Spanish and its literature. Through my teaching, I support you in developing the linguistic and cultural skills that will lead you to succeed in and beyond my courses. At the same time, I invite you to reflect on your personal daily reality while we enjoy reading the works of Spanish literature.

Thanks to my experience as a coach and instructor, I am great at active listening, setting goals, finding perspective, creative awareness and, overall, helping other to find the light that shines within themselves.
