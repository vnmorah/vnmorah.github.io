## About Valeria

<img align="left" src='/assets/images/aboutphoto.jpg' width='30%' style='margin-right:1em' > I am Valeria Mora-Hernández, Spanish Literature Ph.D. and Life Coach. My life has been shaped by my experience being a (white-passing) female of color together with being a first-generation immigrant, first-generation Ph.D., college instructor, researcher and academic writer. 

Either as a Ph.D. or as a Coach, I support you in the process of developing the skills that will help you succeed in your academic, professional, and/or personal life.

Through more than 10 years in Higher Education, I have learned that *well-being is the best strategy you can use to achieve personal and professional success*. However, well-being and success look different for everyone! As a coach, I support you in the process of identifying how do well-being and success look for you within your unique context. Together, we work towards accomplishing your personal and professional goals. 

As a Spanish Literature Ph.D., I am a specialist in Early Modern Spanish narrative as well as in teaching Spanish as a foreign language. I can assist you in the process of learning Spanish and its literature. Through my teaching, I support you in developing the linguistic and cultural skills that will lead you to succeed in and beyond my courses. At the same time, I invite you to reflect on your personal daily reality while we enjoy reading the works of Spanish literature.

In my experience as a coach and instructor, I discovered that I am passionate about helping others to find the light that shines within themselves. 

### Some of my skills are:

- Building trust
- Creating awareness
- Finding and nurturing other'sstrengths
- Motivating groups andindividuals to complete projects
- Articulating overall goals & creating mini-goals for others
- Giving positive feedback
- Active listening
- Verbal & Written communication
- International and multicultural awareness
- Bilingual Spanish & English
