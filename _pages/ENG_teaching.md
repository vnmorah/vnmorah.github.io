# Teaching

As a Spanish Ph.D., my teaching specializations are Early Modern Spanish literature, with an additional expertise in teaching Hispanic literature and Spanish as a foreign language. I have taught across levels as an instructor of records at the University of Notre Dame, as well as a teacher assistant at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

# Research

My research studies violence and marginalization in Early Modern Spanish literature. My dissertation examines the causes and effects of violence among characters in Lázaro de Tormes, Quevedo’s El buscón, Cervantes’s Novelas ejemplares, and María de Zayas’s Desengaños amorosos. Beyond interpreting violence as repetitions of rhetoric and literary stereotypes of the period, my analysis shifts the focus to analyzing the aggressions’ effects on marginalized subjects from the perspectives of disability, violence, and gender studies. I argue that physical and psychological aggressions impact the characters’ behaviors and identities while they also attempt to meet the sociocultural expectations of the period. I conclude that the protagonists use a variety of strategies such as mobility, silence, cross-dressing, and economic transactions to cope, denounce, and resist their positions as victims or survivors.
