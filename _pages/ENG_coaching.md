## Could you benefit from coaching?

Is there an upcoming opportunity or challenge that you want to leverage? Do you feel "stuck" on the path to achieving your goals? These are two excellent examples of topics to bring to a coaching conversation.
Other common reasons for partnering with a coach include:
- Optimizing work performance
- Expanding career opportunities
- Increasing self-esteem/self-confidence
- Maximizing potential
- Defining strengths and weaknesses
- Improving business management strategies
- Managing work/life balance

### Valeria's Coaching
In my own experience as a coachee, I realized that most of the techniques that I was learning were not available to other students in other universities or countries. Thus, I identified something I could to help less privileged communities. I began coaching undergraduate and graduate students in 2018. Many of theme were firends and colleagues who were struggling to keep up their academic performance while also coping with their mental health and trying to find a better work-balance. To better support my clients, I joined as a member  of the [International Coaching Federation](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/f7daf1ad-3ad2-4b49-b3b0-995bee037dd8) in 2021.
