Do you need someone to read your draft before submitting it? Do you feel stuck with your writing? Maybe you don't feel that is ready for your professor's eyes? I will read your manuscript and give you feedback. You will learn where your text is strong, as well as how to better structure the content and focus of your article.

### What kind of drafts do you review?
Class essays, academic articles, dissertation proposals and chapters, job applications, and more.
