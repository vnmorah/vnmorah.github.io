Hello there! Have you noticed how sometimes we feel like everything was due yesterday, even when is not?

This is my modified version of Eisenhower's Matrix. I like it because it helps us to organize all our tasks by assigning them a priority.

## How to use it?
- Write a list of all the things you want or have to do.
- Assign them a quadrant: is it urgent and important or only important?
- Write the tasks in your matrix.
- Take the necessary action for each task: do it, schedule, ask for help or simply delete it.

Ideally, you will always stay in the quadrant that says "Delay" (which is also the equivalent of "Schedule").

### Remember: Not everything is urgent and not everything is always important.
